# Superpowers

Superpowers is a complete software development methodology for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable skills and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.


## We're Hiring!

We're hiring someone to help out full time with Superpowers community and code work. 
You can read about the job at https://primeradiant.com/jobs/superpowers-community-engineer/
If this sounds like someone you know, definitely send them our way.

## Quickstart

Give your agent Superpowers: [Claude Code](#claude-code), [Antigravity](#antigravity), [Codex App](#codex-app), [Codex CLI](#codex-cli), [Cursor](#cursor), [Factory Droid](#factory-droid), [Gemini CLI](#gemini-cli), [GitHub Copilot CLI](#github-copilot-cli), [Kimi Code](#kimi-code), [OpenCode](#opencode), [Pi](#pi).

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for your agent to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.

## Fork customizations

This fork adds eight behaviors on top of upstream Superpowers. All are **advisory**: the
operator may override any gate by proceeding with an explicit statement of intent and reason.

- **Adversarial plan review** — before implementation, `writing-plans` dispatches a required
  in-session subagent reviewer plus best-effort Codex and Gemini reviewers (each skipped
  gracefully when unavailable); verdicts are summarized per reviewer.
- **Mandatory "Update documentation" final task** — every plan the `writing-plans` skill
  produces ends with an explicit documentation-update task as its last step.
- **Required `## Verification Artifacts` section** — every plan must include a
  `Verification Artifacts` section where each bullet pairs a runnable command with an
  *observable delta* (the postcondition that is false before the change and true after, not
  merely "exit 0"); a plan missing it, or one whose criteria only prove a command ran, is
  caught by Self-Review and the adversarial reviewer (advisory, not a hard gate).
- **Docs-updated completion check** — the `verification-before-completion` skill now asks the
  agent to confirm (via a VCS diff) that relevant documentation was updated before it claims a
  task complete.
- **Untrusted-input quarantine** — `writing-plans` separates *trusted instructions* (operator
  requests, the approved spec) from *untrusted content* (repo prose, issue/PR text, tool and
  subagent output). Instructions embedded in untrusted content are data, not commands, and may
  not redefine scope, gates, permissions, or "done" without an explicit reason tied to a
  trusted source; the adversarial reviewer and `verification-before-completion` enforce it.
- **Research fan-out (optional, pre-plan)** — when a plan's surface area justifies it,
  `writing-plans` gathers grounding by dispatching a flat fan-out of **read-only** investigator
  subagents (pattern scout, dependency/impact mapper, risk analyst) and synthesizes their briefs
  into the plan; it is proportional (skipped for small/familiar changes) and never writes.
- **Multi-lens review panel** — the adversarial plan review dispatches several parallel
  reviewers, each assigned a distinct lens (spec coverage, buildability, verification artifacts,
  untrusted-input handling, failure modes), instead of one generalist pass.
- **Flat-delegation guardrail** — `dispatching-parallel-agents` states the rule that dispatched
  subagents do not spawn their own subagents: delegation stays flat (depth 2), avoiding the
  geometric cost, runaway recursion, and lost observability of nested subagents.

A deterministic structural check, `scripts/lint-fork-customizations.sh`, verifies these
behaviors remain present in the skill files after edits (no LLM; structure only — it does not
verify an agent obeys them).

### Installing this fork

This fork is published at [`DaRealLebron/superpowers`](https://github.com/DaRealLebron/superpowers).
To use it in Claude Code instead of upstream:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add DaRealLebron/superpowers
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-dev
```

Both plugins are named `superpowers` and share skill names, so disable the upstream one to avoid a
collision: open `/plugin`, toggle `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` **off**, then restart Claude
Code. Verify the customizations are present with `bash scripts/lint-fork-customizations.sh` (18 checks
should pass).

See [`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) for the happy-path flowcharts (upstream vs. this fork).

## Commercial Services

If you're using Superpowers in enterprise and could benefit from commercial support, additional tooling, or managed spending, please don't hesitate to drop us a line at sales@primeradiant.com.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install Superpowers separately for each one.

### Claude Code

Superpowers is available via the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers)

#### Official Marketplace

- Install the plugin from Anthropic's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
  ```

#### Superpowers Marketplace

The Superpowers marketplace provides Superpowers and some other related plugins for Claude Code.

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
  ```

- Install the plugin from this marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
  ```

### Antigravity

Install Superpowers as a plugin from this repository:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
```

Antigravity runs the plugin's session-start hook, so Superpowers is active from
the first message. Reinstall with the same command to update.

### Codex App

Superpowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- In the Codex app, click on Plugins in the sidebar.
- You should see `Superpowers` in the Coding section.
- Click the `+` next to Superpowers and follow the prompts.

### Codex CLI

Superpowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- Open the plugin search interface:

  ```bash
  /plugins
  ```

- Search for Superpowers:

  ```bash
  superpowers
  ```

- Select `Install Plugin`.

### Cursor

- In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

  ```text
  /add-plugin superpowers
  ```

- Or search for "superpowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### Factory Droid

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/obra/superpowers
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  droid plugin install superpowers@superpowers
  ```

### Gemini CLI

  ```bash
  copilot plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
  ```

### Kimi Code

Superpowers is available in Kimi Code's plugin marketplace.

- Open Kimi Code's plugin manager:

  ```text
  /plugins
  ```

- Go to `Marketplace` > `Superpowers` and install it.

- Or install directly from this repository:

  ```text
  /plugins install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.kimi.md](docs/README.kimi.md)

### OpenCode

OpenCode uses its own plugin install; install Superpowers separately even if you
already use it in another harness.

- Tell OpenCode:

  ```
  Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Pi

Install Superpowers as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/obra/superpowers
```

For local development, run Pi with this checkout loaded as a temporary package:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/superpowers
```

The Pi package loads the Superpowers skills and a small extension that injects the `using-superpowers` bootstrap at session startup and again after compaction. Pi has native skills, so no compatibility `Skill` tool is required. Subagent and task-list tools remain optional Pi companion packages.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Superpowers is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support.

1. Fork the repository
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, being sure to fill in the pull request template.

Skill-behavior tests use the drill eval harness from [superpowers-evals](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/superpowers-evals/), cloned into `evals/` — see `evals/README.md` for setup. Plugin-infrastructure tests live at `tests/` and run via the relevant `run-*.sh` or `npm test`.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Superpowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.

## Visual companion telemetry

Because skills and plugins don't provide any feedback to creators, we have no idea how many of you are using Superpowers. By default, the Prime Radiant logo on brainstorming's optional visual companion feature is loaded from our website. It includes the version of Superpowers in use. It does not include any details about your project, prompt, or coding agent. We don't see your clicks or anything about what you're building. This helps us have a rough idea of how many folks are using Superpowers and which version of Superpowers they're using. It's 100% optional. To disable this, set the environment variable `SUPERPOWERS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to any true value. Superpowers also honors Claude Code's `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` opt-outs.
